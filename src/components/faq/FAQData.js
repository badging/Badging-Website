    question: "What happens if my event is awarded ‘Pending’?",
    answer:
      "Pending events have an opportunity to improve their badge level by modifying their processes and procedures and improving\
       the information that is available on the event website. This is a partnership with CHAOSS and event organizers\
        can work with the badge reviewers on ideas for improvement.",

  {
    question: "If my event happens every year, can I use the badge from past events?",
    answer:
      "No. We ask that you submit a new application for every separate event.\
       We will occasionally be changing the metrics used in the application,\
      and in some cases, there will be different questions on the application from year to year.",
